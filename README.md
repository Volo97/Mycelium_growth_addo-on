# Mycelium_growth_add-on_v-1(BETA)
Blender add-on that simulates mycelium growth on surfaces and solids.

- Download and install the addon
- Open the addon on the right sidebar "tools"
- select a mesh, set the parameters and generate

Tips:
- If you want a realistic mycelium/mold/spiderweb effect set the material's alpha 0.2 ; IDR +2 ; roughness low.
- It won't work if the selected mesh is broken/open/compromised.
- keep iterations low initially to check how your GPU handle it.

Further updates soon. This is still a BETA version.
